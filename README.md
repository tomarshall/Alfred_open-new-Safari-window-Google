# Alfred_open-new-safari-window
### An Alfred workflow that opens a new Safari window and Googles whatever you type after the keyword.

This Alfred workflow opens a new Safari tab with keyword "ns", and Google searches whatever you type after "ns".

**e.g.** If you write "ns snoop dogg", a new Safari window will open the Google search results for "snoop dogg".
If you only type "ns" into Alfred, the workflow will simply open a new Safari window.
